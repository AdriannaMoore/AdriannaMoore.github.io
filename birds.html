<strong>"Birds of a feather flock together"</strong>

<br/><br/>

Birds offer you an incredible variety of species. Birds range in size and color. Some birds can sing. Some can even speak. Parrots are an example of birds that can speak. Canaries can sing. Cockatiels can be taught to do tricks.

Not all birds make good pets. Birds that make great pets are typical companion birds, such as Finches, Canaries, Parakeets, Cockatiels, and Parrots.
